# The Game Vault

## _- By Gaurav Khurana_

## Overview

The Game Vault is a web application for online purchase and rental of video games for Playstation & Xbox One console.

- Web Application for Mobile & Desktop
- Purpose - Online Rental & Purchase of console video games for Playstation & Xbox One

## Problem

I love games which have a story to it. For me, the problem has been that if I purchase a game and I am done with my game play & story mode, I don't know what to do with so either I have to sell it online or let it sit in my shelf. I always wished if I could rent out the game for 15days or 30days that would enough time to enjoy the game & return back to the store.
Hence, "The Game Vault" platform which lets you decide if you want to rent the game or purchase it.
